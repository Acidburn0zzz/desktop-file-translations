"Blinking dots interact with each other circularly. A surface is filled with "
"a hundred medium to small sized circles. Each circle has a different size "
"and direction, but moves at the same slow rate. Displays the instantaneous "
"intersections of the circles as well as the aggregate intersections of the "
"circles. The circles begin with a radius of 1 pixel and slowly increase to "
"some arbitrary size. Circles are drawn with small moving points along the "
"perimeter. The intersections are rendered as glowing orbs. Glowing orbs are "
"rendered only when a perimeter point moves past the intersection point. "
